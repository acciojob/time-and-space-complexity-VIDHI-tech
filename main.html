    <h1>Understanding Time, Space, and Complexity</h1>
    <p>Time complexity is a crucial concept in computer science that measures how the execution time of an algorithm increases as the input size grows. efficient algorithms strive to minimize time complexity, ensuring faster execution even for larger inputs.</p>
    <p><b>Space Complexity</b> is another fundamental consideration, indicating how much memory an algorithm uses to solve a problem with a given input. It's often denoted as O(n), where 'n' represents the input size. Algorithms with better space complexity optimize memory usage, making them more suitable for resource-constrained environments.</p>
